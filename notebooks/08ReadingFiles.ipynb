    "## File Handling Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "File input/output (I/O) is a fundamental concept in programming. It allows us to read data from files and write data to files. This is particularly useful when we want to store and retrieve information that persists beyond the lifetime of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of File I/O in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O is important because it enables us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read data from files**: We can extract information stored in files, such as text documents, CSV files, JSON files, etc., and use it in our programs. For example, we can read a CSV file containing geospatial data and perform calculations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write data to files**: We can store data generated by our programs into files for future use or to share with others. For example, we can write the output of a program to a text file or save a graph that you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manipulate files**: We can create, delete, rename, and modify files using file I/O operations. This allows us to manage files and directories on our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases for Reading Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading files is a common task in many programming scenarios. Some common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data analysis**: Reading data from files is essential for performing data analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configuration files**: Many programs use configuration files to store settings and preferences. Reading these files allows us to customize the behavior of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text processing**: Reading text files is often necessary for tasks such as parsing, searching, and manipulating text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Different File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various file formats, the most common ones that you'll work with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text files**: These files contain plain text and are the most common type of file. They can be opened and read using Python's built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CSV files**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files store tabular data, with each line representing a row and each value separated by a comma. Python provides libraries to read and write CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JSON files**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files store structured data in a human-readable format. Python has built-in support for reading and writing JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at GeoPandas, you will also start working with shape files."

    "### Opening and Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can read or write data to a file, we need to open it. Python provides the `open()` function for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening Files with `open()`\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file, we need to specify its name and the mode in which we want to open it. The mode determines whether we want to read, write, or append to the file, as well as whether we want to work with binary or text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general syntax for opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filename` is the name of the file we want to open, including the file extension.\n",
    "- `mode` is a string that specifies the mode in which we want to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several file modes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read mode. Opens the file for reading. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append mode. Opens the file for appending. If the file already exists, new data will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode, allowing us to read or write binary data.\n",
    "- `'t'`: Text mode. Opens the file in text mode, allowing us to read or write text data. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine these modes by specifying multiple characters. For example, `'rb'` opens the file in binary read mode."

    "#### Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "After we finish working with a file, it's important to close it to free up system resources. We can close a file using the `close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's easy to forget to close a file, especially if an error occurs. To ensure that a file is always closed, we can use the `with` statement. The `with` statement automatically takes care of closing the file for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(filename, mode) as file:\n",
    "    # Perform file operations here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed as soon as we exit the block of code. This is a recommended practice for working with files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the basics of file handling, let's practice opening and closing files in Python."

    "When working with files, it is important to follow some best practices to ensure efficient and safe file handling. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening Files**: Always use the `with` statement when opening files. This ensures that the file is properly closed after you are done with it, even if an exception occurs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading Files**: Use the appropriate mode when opening files for reading. The most common modes are `'r'` for reading in text mode and `'rb'` for reading in binary mode. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can also read the file line by line using the `readline()` method or iterate over the file object directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closing Files**: Although the `with` statement takes care of closing the file for you, it is good practice to explicitly close the file after you are done with it, especially if you are working with a large number of files. This can be done using the `close()` method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('file.txt', 'r')\n",
    "   # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "   file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiently Processing Large Files**: When working with large files, it is important to process them efficiently to avoid memory issues. Instead of reading the entire file into memory at once, consider reading it line by line or in chunks. This can be done using a loop or the `readlines()` method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('large_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       for line in file:\n",
    "           # Process each line\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Alternatively, you can use libraries like `pandas` or `numpy` to handle large datasets more efficiently. We will look at both of these in the next section of the course."

    "\n",
    "In this lecture, you've acquired the essential skills for reading files in Python. You've learned the basics of file I/O, how to read text files line by line, read structured data from formats like CSV and JSON, and manage file paths and directories. These skills are fundamental for various data processing, analysis, and manipulation tasks in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done for making it this far 🎂 Next we will look at three libraries, Numpy, Pandas, and GeoPandas in much more detail, so buckle up."
