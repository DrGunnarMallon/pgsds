    "# Loops and Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of programming, the ability to make decisions and repeat actions is fundamental. Conditionals and loops are the building blocks that empower us to write dynamic and intelligent programs. Today, we'll learn about the concepts of conditionals and loops in Python and how they enable us to control the flow of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Need for Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a real-world scenario: a traffic signal. At a traffic signal, a set of conditions determine whether you stop, go, or slow down. Similarly, in programming, we often encounter situations where we need to make choices based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a program that checks whether a student has passed an exam. The condition here is whether the student's score is above a certain threshold. If it is, the program should print \"Pass,\" otherwise, it should print \"Fail.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: Conditional (if-else)\n",
    "score = 75\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 55:\n",
    "    print(\"Pass\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Fail\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we also frequently encounter tasks that need to be performed repeatedly. Loops provide a way to execute a block of code multiple times, which can be incredibly efficient and practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a program that prints the first ten multiples of 5. Instead of writing ten separate print statements, we can use a loop. You'll learn about the syntax in a little bit.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 2: Loop (for)\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(5 * i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. This task involves both decision-making (checking if a number is prime) and repetition (iterating through numbers). We'll use conditionals and loops to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 3: Combining Conditionals and Loops\n",
    "for num in range(2, 101):\n",
    "    is_prime = True\n",
    "    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n",
    "        if num % i == 0:\n",
    "            is_prime = False\n",
    "            break\n",
    "    if is_prime:\n",
    "        print(num, end=' ')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this looks like gibberish to you right now. I promise you, at the end of the lecture, **loops and conditionals** are going to become second nature to you."

    "### Introduction to Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are an essential concept in programming that allows us to make decisions based on certain conditions. In this section, we will explore the need for conditional statements, understand their role in decision-making, and get an overview of Python's conditional structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Need for Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often encounter situations where we need to perform different actions based on certain conditions. For example, consider a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score (as we saw above). Depending on the score, we may want to assign different grades such as A, B, C, etc. This is where conditional statements come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements enable us to write code that can make decisions and choose different paths based on the conditions we specify. Without conditional statements, our programs would execute the same set of instructions regardless of the input or circumstances, limiting their usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of Conditions in Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions are expressions that evaluate to either **true** or **false**. They are used to determine which path our program should take based on the given conditions. In other words, conditions act as the criteria for decision-making in our programs ðŸ§ .\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to write a program that checks if a number is positive or negative. We can define a condition such as \"if the number is greater than zero, it is positive; otherwise, it is negative.\" The condition here is \"number > 0,\" and based on its evaluation, our program can take different actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Overview of Python's Conditional Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't worry if you don't understand this section yet - we are going to look at each structure in much more detail*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several conditional structures that allow us to implement decision-making in our programs. The most commonly used conditional structures in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**if statement**: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to check if a number is positive. We can use the if statement as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 10\n",
    "if number > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**if-else statement**: The if-else statement allows us to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's modify our previous example to print \"The number is negative\" if the condition is false:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = -5\n",
    "if number > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**if-elif-else statement**: The if-elif-else statement allows us to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that evaluates to true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to assign grades to students based on their scores. We can use the if-elif-else statement as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: D\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic conditional structures in Python that will allow you to implement decision-making in your programs. As you progress in your programming journey, you will encounter more complex conditional statements and structures, but understanding these fundamentals will provide a solid foundation.\n",

    "### The importance of indentation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation is used to define the structure of the code. It is crucial to indent the code correctly to indicate which statements are part of a code block. The `if` statement and other control structures in Python use indentation to determine the scope of the code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the importance of indentation in an `if` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "    print(\"This statement is also part of the code block\")\n",
    "print(\"This statement is not part of the code block\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first `print` statement and the second `print` statement are both indented under the `if` statement. This indicates that both statements are part of the code block that is executed if the condition is true. The third `print` statement is not indented, so it is not part of the code block and will be executed regardless of the condition. The output of this code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x is greater than 5\n",
    "This statement is also part of the code block\n",
    "This statement is not part of the code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that Python uses indentation consistently throughout the code. Inconsistent indentation can lead to syntax errors and unexpected behavior. ðŸš€ Try it out yourself ðŸš€"

The `if` statement evaluates a condition and if it is true, the code block associated with it is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.\n",

    "### The `else` Clause\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the `else` clause is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`. This provides an alternative execution path when the condition is not met.\n",

    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to be executed if condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to be executed if condition is False\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Nested Conditionals\n",

Nested conditionals allow us to create complex decision trees by combining multiple `if` statements within each other. This hierarchical structure of nested conditionals helps us to handle more intricate scenarios and make our programs more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating complex decision trees with nested `if` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested conditionals are useful when we need to check multiple conditions and perform different actions based on the combination of these conditions. By nesting `if` statements, we can create decision trees that branch out based on the outcome of each condition.\n",

    "### Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operators)\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, conditional expressions are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. Ternary operators, also known as conditional expressions, provide a concise way to write conditional statements in Python. They allow you to write a single line of code to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing concise conditional expressions using the ternary operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The ternary operator in Python has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is evaluated first. If it is true, the expression returns `value_if_true`, otherwise it returns `value_if_false`. This allows you to write compact and readable code for simple conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax and practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some practical examples to understand how ternary operators work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Checking if a number is even or odd\n",

    "result = \"even\" if num % 2 == 0 else \"odd\"\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: odd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if the number `num` is divisible by 2. If it is true, the expression returns \"even\", otherwise it returns \"odd\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Checking if a person is eligible to vote\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "result = \"eligible\" if age >= 18 else \"not eligible\"\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: eligible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the condition `age >= 18` checks if the person's age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is true, the expression returns \"eligible\", otherwise it returns \"not eligible\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Finding the maximum of two numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 20\n",
    "max_num = num1 if num1 > num2 else num2\n",
    "print(max_num)  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ternary operators are particularly useful when you have simple conditional statements that can be expressed concisely in a single line. They can improve code readability by reducing the number of lines and making the intention of the code more clear.\n",

    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the concept of repetition is essential to perform tasks repeatedly without having to write the same code multiple times. This is where loops come into play. Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times, making our code more efficient and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How loops enhance code efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are powerful tools that help us automate repetitive tasks. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, we can use loops to iterate through a sequence of elements and perform the same set of instructions on each element. This not only saves us time and effort but also makes our code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using loops, we can avoid duplicating code and make our programs more concise. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when we need to perform a specific operation on each item in a list, for example. This is something that you will be doing throughout Geospatial Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An overview of Python's loop structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides two main loop structures: the `for` loop and the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, string, or range. It allows us to execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example to understand how the `for` loop works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "apple\n",
    "banana\n",
    "cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `for` loop iterates over each item in the `fruits` list and prints it. The loop starts with the first item, \"apple\", then moves on to \"banana\", and finally \"cherry\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It allows us to create a loop that continues until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example to understand how the `while` loop works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition `count < 5` is true. It starts with `count` equal to 0 and increments it by 1 in each iteration. The loop stops when `count` becomes 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Iterating over sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate over sequences such as strings, lists, tuples, and ranges. Let's look at some examples:\n",

    "### Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, loop control statements are used to alter the flow of execution within loops. They allow us to control when to exit a loop prematurely, skip certain iterations, or execute a block of code only when the loop has completed normally. In Python, there are three loop control statements: `break`, `continue`, and the `else` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `break` to exit loops prematurely\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop condition, as we have seen. When encountered, the `break` statement immediately terminates the loop and the program continues with the next statement after the loop. This is useful when we want to stop the execution of a loop based on a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `break`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",

    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "Loop ended\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop iterates over the `numbers` list. When the value of `num` becomes 3, the `break` statement is encountered, and the loop is exited prematurely. As a result, only the numbers 1 and 2 are printed before the loop ends."

    "## Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is an essential concept in programming that allows us to handle errors and unexpected situations in a controlled manner. In this section, we will explore the basics of exception handling in Python and learn how to use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding exceptions and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, the program terminates abruptly unless it is handled properly. Error handling is the process of dealing with these exceptions to prevent program crashes and provide meaningful feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, division by zero, or accessing an index out of range. Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions, and you can also create your own custom exceptions to handle specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions in Python, we use the `try` statement along with one or more `except` clauses. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType1:\n",
    "    # Code to handle ExceptionType1\n",
    "except ExceptionType2:\n",
    "    # Code to handle ExceptionType2\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if no exception occurred\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that will always execute, regardless of exceptions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the different blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, the control is transferred to the appropriate `except` block.\n",
    "- Each `except` block specifies the type of exception it can handle. If the exception raised matches the type specified in an `except` block, the code within that block is executed.\n",
    "- The `else` block is optional and is executed only if no exception occurs in the `try` block. It is typically used to perform actions that should only happen when no exceptions are raised.\n",
    "- The `finally` block is also optional and is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used to release resources or perform cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to understand how exception handling works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = int(input(\"Enter another number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No exceptions occurred.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always execute.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we ask the user to enter two numbers and perform division. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value), a `ValueError` exception is raised and handled by the first `except` block. If the user enters zero as the second number, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised and handled by the second `except` block. If no exceptions occur, the code in the `else` block is executed. Finally, the code in the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling unexpected errors gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is important to handle specific exceptions, it is equally important to handle unexpected errors gracefully. To achieve this, we can use a generic `except` block that catches all exceptions. However, it is generally recommended to handle specific exceptions whenever possible, as catching all exceptions can hide potential bugs in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates handling unexpected errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(\"An unexpected error occurred:\", str(e))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `except` block catches any exception that occurs and prints a generic error message along with the exception details. This helps in identifying and debugging unexpected errors during development."

    "#### Syntax of List Comprehensions\n",
