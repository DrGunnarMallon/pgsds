    "\n",
    "Python provides a rich set of standard libraries that cover a wide range of domains. Here are some commonly used standard libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `math`: This library provides mathematical operations and functions, such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and mathematical constants.\n",
    "- `random`: This library allows you to generate random numbers and perform random selections. It is useful for simulations, games, and cryptography.\n",
    "- `datetime`: This library provides classes for working with dates, times, and time intervals. It allows you to perform various operations, such as formatting dates, calculating time differences, and parsing date strings.\n",
    "- `os`: This library provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform operations such as file and directory manipulation, environment variable access, and process management.\n",
    "- `json`: This library provides functions for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. It allows you to encode Python objects into JSON strings and decode JSON strings into Python objects.\n",
    "- `re`: This library provides support for regular expressions, which are powerful tools for text processing and pattern matching. It allows you to search, replace, and manipulate strings based on patterns.\n",
    "- `collections`: This library provides additional data structures beyond the built-in lists and dictionaries. It includes useful data structures such as named tuples, ordered dictionaries, and counters.\n",

You can import standard libraries in different ways. Here are some of the most common ways to import standard libraries:\n",

    "- Importing the entire library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",

    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "print(sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import math as m\n",
    "print(m.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally recommended to import the entire library or import specific functions/classes rather than using the `from library import *` syntax, which you might see in some older code. This helps avoid naming conflicts and makes it clear which library a function or class belongs to."
